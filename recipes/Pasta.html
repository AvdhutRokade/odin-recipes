    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I came up with this white spaghetti sauce recipe one night to serve with dried pasta and spicy battered shrimp. 
        My husband lived in Italy for three years, so he's really picky about his Italian cuisine. 
        He loved this sauce and thought I spent all day on dinner. 
        It is really hard to mess up this kind of white sauce. 
        In my opinion, it's similar to Alfredo sauce but without cheese.
